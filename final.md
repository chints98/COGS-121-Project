## Team Contribution Summary

The team had a variety of skill sets spanning across design and development that worked well with one another. The whole team contributed in terms of generating feasible ideas, informal design critique and converging to the main project idea. 

Chaitanya Prashant worked on full-stack development and initial interaction design, aiding in sketching out the user flow of the app. Completed initial back-end development with another team member, architected style guide in conjunction with front-end implementation of interface from skeleton through to final version. Implemented detailed interactions 


Judy Chun worked on front-end development during the initial prototyping phase building the skeleton of the login page, call-to-action items such as "Donate" and "Volunteer" elements, and sketched out the interaction flow of how to implement the ajax interaction using the "Learn More" button as a way to show a short blurb of each individual news articles. Made use of visual style guide so that the team can consistently refer back to same color palette, logo usage, iconography, and button states. Working on the demo video to further help brand the app.
