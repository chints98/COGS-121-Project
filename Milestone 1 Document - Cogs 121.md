### Chosen Topic 

Our idea stems from the motivation to reduce the cognitive and information overload associated with juggling multiple applications at once to keep up with **real-time news events happening globally, specifically for the use case of *baby boomers**. 

Moreover, our idea is geared toward increasing awareness of all the **tragic news events** happening in the world right now so that we can make way for future opportunities for either **donation** to pay forward or **volunteering hours** to help out those going through tragedy. Often times, Facebook spits out news articles in news feed to share condolences and link the GoFundMe page sporadically, but our idea wants to provide a **call-to-action items like “Donation” and “Volunteer”** consistently whenever the user accesses our app. 

We believe that there are future opportunities to explore further in this idea, such as data visualization regarding natural disaster outbreaks (ex: wildfire instances) or shooting incidents over time in domestic vs. global regions. With an easily streamlined process accessible through a singular app - news feed geared toward real-time tragic events, our idea aims to encourage volunteering hours and crowdsourced funds like GoFundMe for baby boomers to pay forward and easily stay in touch with upcoming tragic news without having to juggle through multiple apps at once. 


### Target User Population

We are designing an app directed to people who are part of the Baby Boomers demographic cohort and express the need to have different spectrum of news events to be streamlined into one platform. 
Millenials are often targeted for the majority of apps, so we are straying away from targeting this generation and focus on the needs of more senior demographics. These individuals struggle with juggling multiple apps to keep up with worldwide tragic news and look for future opportunities to pay forward or donate to causes in need of help. 
For example, some recent events like the Notre Dame Cathedral Fire cause and New Zealand Mosque shooting are potential causes that people may want to pay forward to. Our team members are not part of this target user population because we are in the Generation Z demographic cohort, and often use multiple apps simultaneously to keep up with potential causes for donation and news events, such as GoFundMe, an online crowdsourcing app and Facebook.

### Possible API’s and sources of data

*  [Predict HQ](https://www.predicthq.com/events/disasters)  - API for natural disasters

*  [News API](https://newsapi.org/)  - API in JSON

*  [The Guardian](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/)  /  [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/)  /  [SeekStorm](https://seekstorm.com/) - API for news, which we could filter/search through for natural disaster news

**Stay-at-home mom**: Wanting to find ways to volunteer and distribute her hours to a good cause for tragic events happening in the world. Having difficulty maneuvering through multiple apps at once on her phone (CNN, Facebook, etc.) She needs an easy way to find out how she can volunteer her hours for real-time tragic events happening nearby without having to juggle between multiple other apps. Our app would satisfy this need of instantly providing a call-to-action items for the stay-at-home mom to volunteer instantly. 




### Storyboard 2

**Full-time working dad**: Surfing through long Facebook newsfeed endlessly and sporadically finding important news article surfacing that discusses about tragic events. He wants to pay forward and donate for the cause but he struggles to find options to instantly donate until he randomly lands at a GoFundMe page that isn’t linked often. He needs an easy, quick way to find out how he can donate for causes happening globally without being bombarded with random articles on Facebook newsfeed. Our app would satisfy this need of instantly providing a call-to-action items for the full-time working dad to donate and get involved immediately.

#### Appendix — other potential ideas

* Minorities and rights / voting rights 

	* Voters report a high barrier to getting actionable information (policies of different candidates, etc.)

	* People, especially minorities, don’t vote because the process is intimidating 

	* The ages 18-29, but especially those who are minorities tend to turnout to elections much less

	* The workflow of current solutions are very prescriptive and include a possibility of bias.

	* Presents stances -> user selects stances 

	* How might we design for a paradigm that keeps decision making in the hands of the voter? 

	* The voter should choose stances, and then the party they align w/ based on said stance. 

	* The weight, or the importance of an issue to isn’t represented by just counting the number of issues that a voter agrees on with a certain party.

* Encourage people to donate food for the homeless and underserved 

	* Digitizing identity and food stamps for paperless transactions, hackathon project (variant)

		*  [https://github.com/esfrankel/food_coin](https://github.com/esfrankel/food_coin)  

	* Sharing passion and stories to underprivileged people or refugees

		* Inspire and expose individuals to a field/passion that a mentor shares

		* If an individual likes what mentor is telling him_her, then have mentor provide action list that can help individual to engage in that passion_work - gain points as a result 

	* Vocab building game 

		* 60 seconds

		* Choose topic: sports, animals, countries…

		* Display first letter

		* Write something that is relevant to the topic

		* Get points

		* Show more relevant facts, for example countries

			* Show main facts: capital, population, typical dish, tourist attractions 

* An application targeting the user group of vegetarians/vegans or those trying to get into a sustainable lifestyle

	* idea : enter a dish and the app will veganize it for you and suggest recipes/substitutions

		* this could be incorporated with a recipe database [but not really sure how it’ll match e.g. if i enter steak, what criteria will i search for or match to get back something like tofu steak] 

	* idea : vegan social media platform - sharing recipes or ways for sustainable living i.e. metal straws, home gardens, sustainable toothbrushes etc. 

	* idea : geotagging vegan restaurants_eateries and also allowing you to check whether an item is vegan or cruelty free /_ vegan/ethical source checker - finding out whether the source has ethical farming practices etc or geotagging verified locations 

	* or a sort of combination of all the above
