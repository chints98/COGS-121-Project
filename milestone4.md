# Milestone 4 Document

## UI Screenshots 

For this milestone of the project, we wanted the UI to be an even more refined skeleton of our previous work, with improvements made keeping usability and a better holistic experience in mind. 

While some styles are still to be refined, this represents a work in progress indicator towards creating a polished product in terms of visual design and full functionality. 


#### News Feed

Most of our UI design changes, pertaining to both usability and interaction design, are housed in the news feed, which is also the main view of the application.

###### Article card

The article card has the most significant amount of change from the previous iteration, with each news article housed in a visually discernible “card-container”. There are changes to make spacing between text more consistent, and we made the “learn more” CTA more usable through feedback (change in color) once a user hovers. 


###### US / world toggle buttons

These buttons, blue and just functional has new interaction design changes, similar to the “learn more” CTA, letting the user have context in terms of what they’re viewing.  

It’s hover-able to signify whether it can be clicked, and shows which option is active.  



#### Navigational tab bar

The navigation bar also works in a similar way, with the active page being seen in our brand’s primary green, while the other navigation elements are hover-able (signifying that they can indeed click on that). 

In terms of UI changes, our aim was to solidify a set of common interaction patterns that serve the use case of our target audience, 




## User Action 1 
The user can go to another “page” in the news feed by clicking another page on the navigational tab bar, and new news articles are loaded according to whether the user wants US related or Global news

Note: this all still gets loaded on the same page (News Feed). 

## User Action 2
The user can toggle between US related and Global news articles, with the news articles loading on the same page.
