### Difference from UI skeleton in Milestone 2

For this milestone, we have extended some of our ideas for the interface that existed in milestones 1 and 2. More specifically, we have added a mid-fidelity branding and logo to our interface, which provides a consistent look and feel for our user. The user is now able to choose between displaying domestic news or local news, with enough context provided over what kind of news is being displayed. 

The user can now donate or volunteer from the NewsFeed itself, simply by clicking on Learn More and clicking on either of the two calls to action. This leads to the main goal of the app being accessible in less steps, but we must consider the tradeoff of presenting all the possible information (full article body), or perhaps a short blurb or summary. 

Another key element of our interface is the sticky tab bar at the bottom, with the intention being to aid navigation, making it easier for the user to quickly parse through the available articles on the app..

### News Feed

* News feed with styled call to action to learn more about the article, a way to toggle between US news articles and global news articles, as well as a tab bar navigation at the bottom.

### Interaction for donating and volunteering.  

* Here, we hoped to implement a way for the user to easily access the appâ€™s main calls to action, which is to either Donate or Volunteer.
