# **Milestone 2**
### **Difference from Proposal**
We have kept the same idea from Milestone 1. 

Both of our ideas across Milestone 1 and 2 stay consistent with the theme of providing easy accessibility to either donate or volunteer directed to the needs of baby boomer demographic cohort. Based on the given feedback, we wanted to design screens with clear features that demonstrate call-to-action items and user tasks that are feasible to carry out when developing our minimum viable product for Milestone 2.

Our idea is similar because we are still focusing on providing updates on real-time news events, particularly tragic news events, along with call-to-action items such as ‘Donate’ and ‘Volunteer’ to solve the problem of older demographics struggling with keeping up with the news when juggling with multiple applications and having to scroll endlessly on Facebook app (for instance) to access GoFundMe page.

### **Difference btw/ Screenshots & Paper Prototypes**
There are few similarities and differences between the two. We will not have an onboarding screen after the user signups. We have also not included potential features such as messaging (for volunteering as shown in our Paper Prototype 1) within the skeleton yet, as we plan to explore these in a low fidelity first before coding a messaging feature that we might not even have to implement!

We have also excluded other extra components such as the previous week’s donation graph (shown in Paper Prototype 2) for now, for the same reason above of sticking to a low fidelity skeleton first. Our screenshots are also different because in Prototype 1 we only featured a ‘Volunteer’ button and in Prototype 2 we only featured a ‘Donate’ button, but in our screenshot we have incorporated both of these buttons to provide a variety of options for the user.

The main similarity between the paper prototypes and our Milestone 2 screenshots is the fact that the news feed (referring to home screen) will show a column of news articles featuring natural disasters and tragic news stories. By clicking on each of the news article, a user can select whether he or she wants to donate or volunteer for that cause.
